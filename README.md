# BattleShift

* An API for multi-player battleship.
* This is a brownfield project built on top of an existing battleship game for a single player and computer. Players sign up for an account, and will receive an email with their API key and a link to activate their account. Once activated, they are able to send post requests using their API key to create a new game, place their ships and fire shots on the opposing player.
* The deployed version can be found here: [BattleShift] (https://immense-woodland-83336.herokuapp.com/)
* The spec for this project can be found here: [Project Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/battleshift)
