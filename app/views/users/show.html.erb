  <p>Great, you're ready to play!</p>

  <p>All requests need to be made with a valid API key. Send that information in your header, formatted as key 'X-API-KEY' and value of your api key.</p>

  <p>To start a game, post a request to "/api/v1/games" with params posted in the body as "opponent_email: YOUR_OPPONENT_EMAIL". Your opponent needs to be active in the system for this to work. Make note of your game id, as you will be using to place ships and shots.</p>

  <p>To place your ships, send a post request to "/api/v1/games/#{game_id}/ships". Pass the following information in the body:
      <li>ship_size: 3</li>
      <li>start_space: "A1"</li>
      <li>end_space: "A3"</li>

  <p>To shoot at your opponent's ship, send a post request to "/api/v1/games/#{game_id}/shots" with params of 'target: "D1"' posted in the body.</p>
